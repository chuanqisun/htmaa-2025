(work in progress)

## Group activity

- Soldering:
  - Use diagnol anchoring
  - Need more practice to speed up
- with Ceci, Eitan, and Miranda
- Demos Arduino Mega and Uno
- Tested Arduino IDE, Platform IO (had driver issue)
- Later, tested Arduino CLI and Thonny MicroPython for Xiao RP2040
- Had fun building an "Affective computing" demo where plugging a jumper cable into the board causes "ouch" to appear from serial port

## Individual

- Reading data sheet for RP2040
- Run sample programs fron instructors in Arduino IDE
- Migrating to VSCode with Arduino CLI scripts, establish custom workflow
- Building a basic "cube viewer", spent lots of time tuning the capacitive touch pads
- New mental model: we measure how long it takes to pull up the voltage. Human body slows it down (minor leaks into the "ground").
- TODO: use serial port to communicate with a laptop, two-way passing text encaded data

## Final project

- Need to prototype on ESP32 with networking, see if we can send texts onto the device, wired or wireless
