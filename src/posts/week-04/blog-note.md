- 3D printing
  - After the group activity
  - Tested printing simple 2D shapes, produced bookmarks
  - Then printed designed a cage in Tinkercad, which should satisfy the non-subtractive requirement
  - Next, I wanted to print feather inside the cage to add a poetic touch
  - I first tried printing the feather horizontally in the cage, but it was too small to see.
  - Then I printed the feather separately, tried both printing it horizontally and vertically. The vertical version looked better.
  - Next, I want to challenge myself by printing something more difficult. So I designed a 4D cube, also known as tesseract, and put it in the same cage.
  - Finally, I want to add a movable element, so I printed a ball inside a cube cage, the ball's diameter is the same as the cube so it won't fall out.
- 3D scanning
  - Scanned basket and a mannequin with Polycam
  - Mannequin had serious issue due to reflective surface
  - Proceed to print basket.
- Used blender to convert .glb to .stl, then imported to PrusaSlicer for printing
