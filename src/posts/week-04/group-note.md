1. Ben made a model for over hang test
   1. We found a more comprehensive overhang test model
   1. We decide to reduce the print area. No need to print the angles that we are certain about
1. Import the model in STL format, then export for Prusa
   1. Discussed about unit can aggreed that there was no unit in the file. THe user needs to assign the unit
   2. Export gcode vs. bgcode? The flash drive we found used bgcode, so we decided to use that
1. Printing
   1. We rushed to start, and didn't preheat the base plate. The filamengt didn't stick to the base. We started over with properly preheating the base plate, roughly 5 minutes.
   2. Yufeng showed us how to load filament. The machine seems to detect filament automatically
   3. The machine automatically purges the old filament
   4. The machine worked well for the first 20 minutes but suddenly the nozzle got clogged. We had to abort
